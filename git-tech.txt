3.$ git status ( created a txt file but not commited hence you would see below as a untracked files, you need to add that file first to index)
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        git.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Sevita@HP MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Tech/Git-Project (master)

$ git add git.txt(you can even add folder as well)

Sevita@HP MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Tech/Git-Project (master)

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   git.txt
